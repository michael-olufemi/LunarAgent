Lunar Agriculture Sensor Anomaly Detector ðŸŒ±ðŸŒ•

This project implements a **modular and extensible anomaly detection system** for environmental sensor data collected from space agriculture experiments (e.g., EDEN ISS, VEGGIE, APEX).

### ðŸš€ Overview

The system simulates real-time data streaming and performs **per-sensor anomaly detection** using a simple but effective **z-score method**. It is designed to serve as the foundation for an autonomous AI agent that monitors telemetry from a lunar greenhouse.
